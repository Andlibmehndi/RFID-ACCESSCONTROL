# RFID-ACCESSCONTROL
              
The Basic necessity of security can be attained by designing various door locks such as mechanical locks or electrical locks. These kind of door locks are designed with one or more keys, but for locking a large area various locks are needed. Generally, traditional locks are heavy and that are not strong as they can damage simply by using some tools. Electronic Locks are better over mechanical locks, to resolve the security problems that are connected with the mechanical locks. In recent days every device uses digital technology. For example, identification of digital device using token, door lock system using digital technology, automatic door opening and closing, automatic door lock systems, etc. These kind of systems is used for controlling the movement of a door without using a key.[4]  
We store a set of RFID card data in our system, say 2 to 4 RFID card data. When the person with the right RFID card (compatible to data preloaded in our program/system) come and swipes his RFID tag, access will be granted. When the person with the wrong RFID card (whose data is not loaded in our system) swipes his RFID tag, access will be denied.[5]
  
     
Component Require fro this project  
Software:-   
	Arduino IDE(1.8.3)  
	Gobetwino (beta)    
Hardware:-
	RFID Reader and tags  
	Arduino Uno Board  
	Bread Board  
	Connecting Wires  
	LCD panel  
	Buzzer   

  
I have used Gobetwion softwere because to take system time and date it is not possible to take in arduno using serial interface so uou have to used RTC Module(real time clock) or just used this softwere which communicate with arduno and system
