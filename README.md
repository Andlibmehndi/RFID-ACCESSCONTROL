# RFID-ACCESSCONTROL
                                      Project Definition  
The main objective of this project is to make a use of RFID tag for implementing access control mechanisms.  
The major functionalities of the project are:-  
•	To identify person’s identity based on RFID tag   
•	To grant access in the system (by opening door). Access will be granted to a person with the valid RFID card (compatible to data preloaded in our program/system).  When the person with the invalid RFID card (whose data is not loaded in our system) swipes his RFID tag, access will be denied and details will be added in log file.    
•	To generate reports (log) for system administrator. The log file will be generated for every activity. Log file maintains information like user, date and time, access type and RFID id which is which is very important for administrator.
